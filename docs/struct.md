Since Doxa has a tightly limited number of types, structs are useful for modeling more complex data. Structs are based off composition to avoid pitfalls inherent to inheretance. Variables, functions, and methods are all private unless marked pub.

### Real world example

struct Point {  
    x :: int, // unless marked pub, values are private
    y :: int,

    pub id :: int,

    pub function New(x :: int, y :: int) { // fucntions and methods are private unless marked pub as well
        return Point {
            x is x,
            y is y,
        }
    }

    function safeSub(a :: int, b :: int) returns int { // normal functions within structs are static
        result is a - b
        if result > 255 or result < 0 then return -1
        return result
    }

    pub method get() { // the `method` keyword lets you access 
        return Point {
            this.x,
            this.y
        }
    }

    pub method getDelta() returns int {
        return Point.safeSub(this.x, this.y) // static methods can be called within instance methods
    }

}

### Basic Composition Example

```doxa
struct Animal {
    name: string
}

struct Dog {
    // Composition instead of inheritance
    animal: Animal,
    breed: string,

    fn bark(self) {
        print(animal.name + " says woof!")
    }
}

var dog is Dog {
    animal: Animal {
        name: "Spot"
        },
    breed: "Labrador"
}
```
