# Groups

This document specifies **groups**: a nominal type that merges existing enums, structs, and other groups into a single type, re-exporting their members under qualified names. A group is a **named tagged union** — it provides a single type arm for function signatures and APIs without creating new values.

**Status:** specification. Replaces the prior `set` design. When implemented, update [syntax.md](syntax.md) and [unions.md](unions.md) to reference this page.

## 1. Design invariants

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Members are existing types or other groups | A group contains `enums`, `structs`, and `groups` declared elsewhere |
| Group membership is flattened | Transitive group members are expanded into a flat member list at the declaration site |
| Groups do not create new values | `Error.IO.NotFound` is the same value as `IO.NotFound` |
| A type appears at most once | Deduplication during flattening; reaching the same type through multiple paths is harmless |
| Cycles are illegal | A group may not include itself directly or transitively |
| Nominal type | Each `group` declaration introduces a distinct type; two groups with identical members are different types |

---

## 2. Syntax

### 2.1 Group declaration

A group is declared with the `group` keyword. The body lists member types.

```doxa
public group Error {
    CommonError,
    IOError,
    CompilerError,
    FileError,
}
```

Members are referenced by their unqualified or module-qualified name. Each member contributes its variants/fields under a **qualifier** — its unqualified type name.

```doxa
public group Error {
    error.CommonError,
    error.IOError,
    error.CompilerError,
    structs.FileError,
}
```

### 2.2 Transitive groups

A group may include another group. All members of the included group are **flattened** into the declaring group.

```doxa
public group CoreError {
    IOError,
    CommonError,
}

public group AppError {
    CoreError,      // flattened → IOError, CommonError
    UserCancelled,
    ConfigInvalid,
}
```

`AppError` expands to `{ IOError, CommonError, UserCancelled, ConfigInvalid }`. There is no nesting in the expanded member list.

### 2.3 Qualified access

Members are accessed through the group name with the qualifier:

```doxa
Error.IOError.NotFound
AppError.UserCancelled           // local variant — unqualified under the group
```

When a variant name is unique across all group members, it may be accessed directly:

```doxa
Error.NotFound                   // OK if NotFound exists in exactly one member
```

When ambiguous, qualified access is required:

```doxa
group G {
    A,    // enum with variant X
    B,    // enum with variant X
}
G.X                              // ERROR: ambiguous — X exists in both A and B
G.A.X                            // OK
```

---

## 3. Type system

### 3.1 Nominal identity

Each `group` declaration introduces a distinct nominal type. `AppError` is not the same type as `CoreError`, `IOError`, or `UserCancelled`. Two groups with identical member lists are distinct types.

### 3.2 Member identity preserved

A value's identity is determined by its source type — not by the group that wraps it. `Error.IOError.NotFound` and `IOError.NotFound` are the same value.

| Expression | Type | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `IOError.NotFound` | `IOError` | `IOError::NotFound` |
| `Error.IOError.NotFound` | `Error` | `IOError::NotFound` (same) |
| `AppError.IOError.NotFound` | `AppError` | `IOError::NotFound` (same) |

### 3.3 Widening and narrowing

**Widening (implicit):** A value of a member type is assignable where the group type is expected. The compiler inserts a tag to track which member the value belongs to at runtime.

```doxa
function open(path: string) -> string | Error {
    if path is "" then return IOError.NotFound  // widens to Error
    if path is "/" then return FileError { path } // widens to Error
    return "ok"
}
```

**Narrowing (explicit):** From a group type to a member type via `match` or `as`:

```doxa
x as IOError          // succeeds if x is an IOError member; else the `else` branch runs
```

No implicit narrowing from a group type to a member type.

### 3.4 Equality

Values compare equal when they carry the same source type and same payload.

```
Error.IOError.NotFound == IOError.NotFound     → true
IOError.NotFound == FileError { path: "x" }    → type error (different members)
```

Cross-member equality is a compile error, not `false`.

### 3.5 Unions

A single group member replaces multiple individual arms in return types:

```doxa
// Before
function read() -> string | IOError | CommonError | CompilerError

// After
function read() -> string | Error
```

A function declared `returns string | Error` accepts `string`, any `Error` value, or any value of a member type (widened to `Error`).

---

## 4. Pattern matching

### 4.1 Exhaustiveness

Matching on a group must cover every member. This is a **flat** check over the expanded member list.

```doxa
group Error { IOError, CommonError, FileError }

match err {
    IOError.NotFound => ...
    IOError.PermissionDenied => ...
    // IOError.EOF missing → not exhaustive
    CommonError.* => ...         // wildcard covers all CommonError variants
    FileError { path } => ...
}
```

An exhaustive match requires either:
- a pattern for every variant in every enum member, plus every struct member, or
- a `*` wildcard for any remaining enum members, or
- an `else` arm

### 4.2 Enum patterns

```doxa
match err {
    Error.IOError.NotFound => ...          // single variant
    Error.IOError.* => handle_io(err),     // all IOError variants (narrows to IOError)
    else => ...
}
```

Inside `Error.IOError.*`, the bound value is narrowed to `IOError`.

### 4.3 Struct patterns

Struct members are matched with destructuring syntax:

```doxa
match err {
    Error.FileError { path } => print(path),
    Error.ConfigError { key, value } => ...
}
```

The struct is narrowed to its member type, and fields are available directly.

### 4.4 Matching on unions containing groups

```doxa
match result {
    string => use(result),
    Error => handle(result),        // catch-all for the group
    Error.IOError.* => ...
}
```

## 5. Collisions and ill-formed programs

| Situation | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Two members with the same qualifier after flattening | **Error** |
| Unqualified name exists in more than one member | **Error** (ambiguous access) |
| Cycle in group membership | **Error** |
| Empty group (no members) | **Error** |
| Group member is not a declared type | **Error** |

---

## 6. Runtime representation

A group value has a hidden tag to identify which member it belongs to, followed by the member's payload.

```
Group value = [member_index: u32] [payload: union { enum_variant, struct_instance }]
```

This is identical in shape to how tagged unions already work. The difference is that group members are named and traceable, whereas union arms are anonymous.

The member index is stable for the lifetime of the group declaration. Reordering members changes the index and is an ABI break.

## 7. Grammar sketch

```text
GroupDecl       := 'group' IDENT '{' GroupBody '}'
GroupBody       := ( GroupMember )*
GroupMember     := TypePath  (',' | NEWLINE)*
TypePath        := IDENT ( '.' IDENT )*
```

## 8. Differences from the prior `set` design

| Aspect | `set` (old) | `group` (new) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Members | Enums only | Enums, structs, other groups |
| Local variants | Supported | Not supported — everything is a member type |
| Transitivity | Nested qualifier chains (`AppErr.Std.IO.NotFound`) | Flattened (`AppError.IOError.NotFound`) |
| Duplicate types | Error | Deduplicated silently |
| Runtime shape | Enum discriminant only (zero-cost widen) | Tag + payload (tagged union) |
| `is_set` flag | Unused | Not needed — flattened at parse/semantic time |

---

## 9. Implementation checklist

- [x] Rename `SET_TYPE` token to `GROUP_TYPE` and register the `group` keyword in the lexer.
- [x] Rename `SetDecl`, `SetSource`, `SetMember` AST nodes to `GroupDecl`, `GroupMember` throughout `ast.zig`, parser, semantic, and HIR layers.
- [x] Update `parseSetDecl` to `parseGroupDecl` and remove local variant parsing from the group body.
- [x] Create a `GroupTable` global registry with `GroupId` and flat `Member` entries (`qualifier`, `kind`, `id`).
- [x] Add `HIRType.Group(GroupId)` and remove `HIRType.Set(EnumId)` from `soxa_types.zig`.
- [ ] Unify the duplicated `CustomTypeInfo` definition across `types/types.zig` and `type_system.zig` into a single source of truth.
- [x] Implement flattening: when a group member is another group, expand its members into the declaring group's member list with deduplication by type identity.
- [x] Implement cycle detection by tracking visited group IDs during expansion.
- [ ] Implement ambiguous-name detection by collecting all variant/field names across expanded members and flagging duplicates.
- [x] Add `group_instance: HIRGroup { member_index, payload }` to `HIRValue` for runtime group representation.
- [x] Implement implicit widening from member types to their enclosing group in the type checker (`typeIsGroupMember`, `typeMatchesUnionMember` in `unifyTypes`).
- [x] Implement `match` exhaustiveness checking across the flat expanded member list for both enum variants and struct members.
- [x] Implement domain wildcard patterns (`Group.Member.*`) that narrow the matched value to the member type.
- [x] Implement struct destructuring patterns (`Group.Member { field }`) inside `match` arms.
- [ ] Implement cross-member equality as a compile error.
- [x] Add group type handling to bytecode (`module.zig`) and the VM interpreter.
- [x] Validate that `registerSpecificSymbol` uses the correct `.Group` kind instead of `.Enum` for imported group symbols.
- [x] Fix the fixed-2 allocation in `getSetSourceMemberNames` (or its replacement) to iterate actual expanded members.
