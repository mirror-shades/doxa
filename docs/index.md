# Doxa

```
Neither from itself nor from another,

Nor from both,

Nor without a cause,

Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

- Nāgārjuna
    Verses on the Middle Way (2nd–3rd century CE)
```

Doxa is a simple to write, highly readible language based on four corned logic inspired by the logic of Nagarjuna. In Doxa there are no booleans. Doxa instead uses a four cournered logical unit called a tetra. Tetras can represent true and false, which act as you would expect them to in a traditional programing language.
