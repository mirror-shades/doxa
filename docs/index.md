# Doxa

```
Everything is real and is not real,
Both real and not real,
Neither real nor not real.
This is Lord Buddha’s teaching.

- Nāgārjuna
    Verses on the Middle Way (2nd–3rd century CE)
```

Doxa is a simple to write, highly readible language based on four corned logical values inspired by the logic of Nagarjuna. In Doxa there are no booleans. Doxa instead uses a four cournered logical unit called a tetra. Tetras can represent true and false, which act as you would expect them to in a traditional programing language.
