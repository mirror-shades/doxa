for whatever masochistic reason, I decided to write a compiled language.

Documentation for the language exists as some markdown files but it's not complete. **https://mirror-shades.github.io/doxa/**

things to consider for VM scaling:

- implement garbage collection
- instruction caching
- JIT if really needed
