for whatever masochistic reason, I decided to write a compiled language.

I'm writing it in Zig because I think it's a good choice for the task and it's a good way to learn the language better.
Documentation for the language exists as some md files but it's not complete.

things to consider for VM scaling:

- implement garbage collection
- instruction caching
- JIT if really needed
