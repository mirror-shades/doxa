// Performance Test: u8 Tetras vs Boolean Logic

// Test complex logic chains
var a is true;
var b is both; 
var c is false;
var d is neither;

"=== Complex Logic Chain Test ==="?;

// This would be SLOW with traditional boolean logic (many branches)
// but FAST with our lookup tables (no branches)
var result1 is a and b;    // Lookup: [1][2] = instant
var result2 is result1 and c;  // Lookup: [result1][0] = instant  
var result3 is not result2;    // Lookup: [result2] = instant

result1?;  // Should be: true AND both = true (1)
result2?;  // Should be: true AND false = false (0)  
result3?;  // Should be: NOT false = true (1)

"=== Tetras handle edge cases booleans can't ==="?;
var edge_case is both and neither;  // Impossible with booleans!
edge_case?;
